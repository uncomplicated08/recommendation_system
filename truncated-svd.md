### The Algorithm: Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Imagine you're in a large school cafeteria where everyone is picking their favorite lunch items. Now, suppose you're trying to figure out what new dishes to recommend to each student based on what they and others like. The challenge is, you can't just ask everyone about every dish due to time constraints, so you need a smart way to guess.

Here’s how Truncated SVD helps:

1. **Gathering Data**:
   Just like in your dataset, where each purchase record tells us what products customers bought and in what quantity, think of SVD as gathering information on which dishes students generally choose.

   - In your dataset:
     ```plaintext
     CustomerID, StockCode, Quantity
     17850, 85123A, 6
     17850, 71053, 6
     17850, 84406B, 8
     ```

   Each line tells us a customer (like a student) picked a certain product (like a dish) and how many (akin to how much they liked it).

2. **Creating a Big Table (Matrix)**:
   Imagine creating a huge table or matrix where one side lists all the students (customers), and the top lists all possible dishes (products). Each cell in the matrix shows how much a student liked a dish (based on quantity, or if they didn’t buy it, a zero).

   - Example:
     |        | 85123A | 71053 | 84406B |
     |--------|--------|-------|--------|
     | 17850  |   6    |   6   |   8    |
     | Other IDs |  0   |   0   |   0    |
     (Most cells might be zero because most students don't try most dishes.)

3. **Breaking Down the Table (Decomposition)**:
   Truncated SVD simplifies this huge table. It tries to find patterns like, "Students who like dish A also tend to like dish B," and it reduces the information into something more manageable. It essentially compresses the table while trying to keep the most important patterns intact.

   - Think of it like summarizing a long book into a few key sentences that still give you the main plot.

4. **Making Recommendations**:
   Using the simplified data, Truncated SVD can then predict how much a student might like a dish they haven't tried yet. If the prediction is high, that dish is recommended.

   - For example, if SVD notices a student likes items similar to "85123A" based on patterns, it might suggest "84406B" if that's also liked by similar students.

### Your Recommendations List:

When you see:
```plaintext
Recommendations for user 0:
StockCode                         Description
85123A  WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER
84029E  RED WOOLLY HOTTIE WHITE HEART.
85099B  JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT
21232   STRAWBERRY CERAMIC TRINKET BOX
71477   COLOUR GLASS. STAR T-LIGHT HOLDER
```
This means the algorithm, after analyzing buying patterns, predicts these items are likely to please the customer based on their previous choices and similarities with other customers' choices.
