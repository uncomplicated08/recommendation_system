### Key Components

1. **README.md**
   - **Purpose**: Describes the project, its architecture, how to set it up and run it, and any other relevant information.
   - **Contents**: Include sections on installation, usage, contributions, and license.

2. **requirements.txt**
   - **Purpose**: Lists all Python libraries and their versions needed to run the project.

3. **main.py**
   - **Purpose**: The entry point of the application, initializing the backend and GUI.
   - **Contents**: Setup and launch the GUI, link the backend services.

4. **data/**
   - **Purpose**: Store datasets or scripts to download/process data.

5. **models/**
   - **recommender.py**: Contains the machine learning models for generating recommendations.
   - **preprocess.py**: Includes functions to preprocess the data, such as normalization, handling missing values, etc.

6. **services/**
   - **data_service.py**: Manages data fetching and manipulation.
   - **recommendation_service.py**: Abstracts the interaction with the recommendation model, making it easier to manage from the GUI or other interfaces.

7. **gui/**
   - **main_window.py**: Builds the graphical user interface for the system where users can interact with the model.

8. **utils/**
   - **helpers.py**: Miscellaneous helper functions used throughout the project.

### Development Steps

1. **Setup Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies**:
   - Use `virtualenv` or `conda` to manage dependencies.
   - Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Develop the Backend**:
   - Implement data preprocessing and model training in the `models/` directory.
   - Develop services to manage data fetching and interaction with the model.

3. **Build the GUI**:
   - Design a simple interface where users can select a profile and view recommendations.
   - Implement interaction logic in `gui/main_window.py` to communicate with the backend services.

4. **Integration and Testing**:
   - Ensure all components are integrated seamlessly.
   - Conduct thorough testing to validate functionality and performance.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document every module and function.
   - Update the `README.md` with detailed instructions and information.
